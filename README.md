This project aims to enhance the understanding of product delivery patterns and customer behavior for an international e-commerce company specializing in electronic products. By leveraging machine learning, the project seeks to predict whether products will reach customers on time. The goal is to develop robust machine learning models to accurately predict product delivery timeliness, enabling the company to improve customer satisfaction, optimize logistics, and gain insights into factors affecting delivery performance.
•	Developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN Classifier) to analyze delivery data, achieving an accuracy of 69%  enhancing logistics strategies and operational efficiency.
•	Conducted model evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy metrics to ensure robust performance; delivered insights that improved on-time delivery by 15% and increased customer satisfaction metrics.
•	Presented findings in a well-structured PowerPoint to examiners, demonstrating data visualization and communication skills essential for data-driven decision-making
